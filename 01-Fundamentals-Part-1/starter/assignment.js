// **** Values and Variables - Lecture 10 ****
// Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).

// Log their values to the console.
let country = "Australia";
let continent = "Oceana";
let population = 25000000;

console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);

// **** Data Types - Lecture 11****
// Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.

// Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.
let isIsland = false;
let language;

console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);
console.log(typeof language);

// **** Let, Const and Var - Lecture 12 ****
// Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).

// Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

// Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.
language = "English";
const cntry = "Australia";
const cont = "Oceana";
let island = false;
island = true;
console.log(cont);
console.log(island);
